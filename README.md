# hello-world

Hey! Just starting out on 4/7/20 at 4:36PM; might never come back so I'll explain what's going on. We're in the middle of a 
global pandemic and I am jobless and not sure what kind of career I want to pursue. I think I hate coding so I'll probably 
pursue biostatistics? Thoughts? Notes? I'll be in touch!
