# hello-world

Hey! Just starting out on 4/7/20 at 4:36PM; might never come back so I'll explain what's going on. We're in the middle of a 
global pandemic and I am jobless and not sure what kind of career I want to pursue. I think I hate coding so I'll probably 
pursue biostatistics? Thoughts? Notes? I'll be in touch!

Returned on 3/22/22 at 13:03 for one final course at UNC-CH. How my life has changed! I still dislike coding (lol) but learning FHIR is a necessary evil for me. I am a digital asset manager for a woman's organization and am looking to break into the same position in the healthcare domain. Managing data is such a practical and rewarding way to spend my time ATM. I willl mention I am fascinated by the possibilities afforded by data interoperability and governance, and hope to contribute to those conversations in the near future. Cheers to two life-changing years!
